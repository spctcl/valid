DESCRIPTION:

The Valid protocol is a decentralized concierge platform that integrates zero-trust principles to allow participants to stake any amount of Ethereum (ETH) and earn rewards for securing the network. Using Secret Shared Validator (SSV) technology, Valid provides secure and reliable active-active redundancy while applying its ethos of financial, technical, and legal risk mitigation. Participants can access a user-friendly interface to track their staked amount and rewards, and Valid's core principles of transparency and accessibility are put into action by allowing participants of the non-custodial staking service to monitor their validators' performance and rewards in real-time.



BUSINESS PLAN:

The Valid Protocol is a decentralized concierge platform that allows traditional investors without current Ethereum exposure to participate in staking and earn rewards for securing the network. The platform applies Secret Shared Validator (SSV) technology to provide secure and reliable active-active redundancy while adhering to the principle of zero-trust. The platform charges a management fee of 0-2% and a 10 to 30% carry based on the amount deposited.

Target Market:

Our target market is traditional investors who are interested in cryptocurrency but are not familiar with the technical aspects of staking. We aim to provide a concierge service that is easy to use and transparent, thus providing an entry point for those who are hesitant to invest in cryptocurrency.

Marketing Strategy:

We will target potential clients through digital advertising and traditional marketing methods, such as targeted email campaigns, direct mail, and events. We will also collaborate with financial advisors and asset managers to increase awareness of the Valid Protocol as a viable investment option.

Revenue Model:

The Valid Protocol generates revenue through management fees and carry. The management fee will be between 0-2%, and the carry will be between 10 to 30% based on the amount deposited. These fees will be deducted automatically from the rewards earned by the participants.

Financial Projections:

Based on our market research, we estimate that we can attract $50 million in assets under management in the first year, with an average deposit of $100,000 per participant. This would generate $1 million to $2 million in management fees and $500,000 to $1.5 million in carry. As the platform gains more traction and attracts larger investors, we expect the total assets under management to increase, thus increasing revenue.

Conclusion:

The Valid Protocol is a unique investment opportunity that provides traditional investors with access to the world of cryptocurrency without the need for technical expertise. Our concierge service offers a transparent and easy-to-use platform that is managed by experienced professionals. With our management fee and carry structure, we have a strong revenue model that is sustainable and scalable.



FEE STRUCTURE:

1.) Deposit size up to $100,000: Management fee of 2%, carry of 10%
2.) Deposit size between $100,000 and $500,000: Management fee of 1.5%, carry of 15%
3.) Deposit size between $500,000 and $1,000,000: Management fee of 1%, carry of 20%
4.) Deposit size between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000: Management fee of 0.75%, carry of 25%
5.) Deposit size over $5,000,000: Management fee of 0.5%, carry of 30%

This structure provides a clear incentive for larger deposits, while still maintaining a reasonable management fee for smaller investors. The carry structure also rewards those who make more significant contributions to the protocol's success, with higher levels of carry offered to those who deposit more significant amounts.

These fees and carry percentages are not set in stone and can be adjusted based on market conditions and the needs of the Valid protocol over time. However, they provide a solid starting point for incentivizing larger deposits and rewarding active participants in the Valid ecosystem.
